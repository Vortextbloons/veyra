# Prompt Construction

Veyra assembles authoritative system instructions separately from retrieved or generated reference context. Each block is conditionally included based on the current state.

```
System message:
Veyra core          — Base AI identity and behavior
<veyra_project>     — Active project context
<veyra_character>   — Character persona
<veyra_context>     — Date, time, platform
<veyra_documents>   — Document tool instructions

Non-system reference message:
<veyra_memory>      — Retrieved memory nodes
<veyra_conversation_summary>  — Summary of older turns
<veyra_web_search>  — Untrusted web evidence from tool calls
```

Reference material is admitted only when it fits after the system instructions and active conversation. The newest conversation turn is always retained, and older history is included as a contiguous suffix.
